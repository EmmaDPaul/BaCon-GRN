The codes corresponding to the 3 Bayesian techniques are provided under the folder code


A sample dataset is provided under the folder data.

Dataset columns:
Gene1 : Source Gene
Gene2 : Target Gene
EdgeWeight : The score given by the algorithm for the edge
Direction : An identifier cell for the edge.

The data contains results from gene regulatory network algorithms. Any number of Gene regutlatory inference technique can be used for the bayesian consensus technique.
The corresponding AUPR, AUROC scores can be used for creating the prior value.
